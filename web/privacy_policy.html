    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Mongol Focus. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect your information.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>This app is primarily a local task management application, and the information we collect is very limited:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Task Content</strong>: Task titles, notes, subtasks and other content you create or edit in this app are stored locally on your device only.</li>
      <li><strong>Category Information</strong>: Categories and icons you create are used to organize and filter tasks.</li>
      <li><strong>App Settings</strong>: Settings such as theme, font, and notifications are stored locally on your device.</li>
      <li><strong>Device Information</strong>: To support app functionality, we may collect basic device information (e.g., model, OS version) for improving performance only; it is not used to identify you.</li>
      <li><strong>Network Status</strong>: The app may check network status for related features (e.g., checking for updates); it does not collect or transmit your network activity data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Use of Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect only for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To provide and improve core functionality (task management, categories, search, today view, completed notes, etc.)</li>
      <li>To save your app settings</li>
      <li>To improve app performance and user experience</li>
      <li>To diagnose and resolve technical issues</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All your task content, categories, and app settings are stored in your device's local storage. We do not host your task content on any server or third-party service. All data remains on your device until you actively delete it.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We take appropriate technical measures to protect your data:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>All data is stored locally on your device, with no unnecessary network transmission</li>
      <li>Local storage follows the operating system's security practices and standards</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not share, sell, or rent your personal information or task content with third parties. Your data belongs entirely to you, and we do not access or collect your task content for any other purpose.</p>

    <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>This app may use the following third-party services to provide functionality:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Flutter Framework</strong>: Used for app development; may collect anonymous usage statistics</li>
      <li><strong>System Services</strong>: Uses operating system services (file system, local notifications, network status checks, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Use of these services is governed by their respective privacy policies.</p>

    <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You have full control over your data:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You can view, edit, or delete task content at any time</li>
      <li>You can uninstall the app at any time, after which all locally stored data will be removed</li>
      <li>You can change app settings at any time</li>
    </ul>
